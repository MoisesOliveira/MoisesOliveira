## HiðŸ‘‹. My name is Moises!!!


I'm currently still a junior developer, but yet I have some useful knowledge with Pyhton (Flask framework) and Javascript (with React and vanilla).

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing a NPM package and a frontend application to consume @D3vD/Meme_API (wich is really fun to do).
